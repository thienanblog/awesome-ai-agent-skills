# Awesome AI Agent Skills

A community-shared collection of reusable skills for AI coding agents. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Kilo Code, Windsurf, OpenAI Codex, and any AI tools that support skills or custom instructions.

## Source of Truth

- Author skills only under `skills/<skill-name>/`.
- Assign each skill to exactly one installable bundle in `plugin-groups.json`.
- Treat `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `plugins/**`, and generated README tables as sync outputs.
- Do not edit `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/**` directly; those are Codex plugin package copies regenerated from `skills/`.
- Run `npm run sync` after changing skills or plugin grouping, then run `npm run validate`.

## What are Skills?

Skills are self-contained instruction sets that teach AI agents specific workflows, guidelines, or capabilities. Each skill includes:
- A `SKILL.md` with metadata and instructions
- Optional reference documentation for detailed guidance
- Reusable across any project

## Installation

### Claude Code

**Step 1: Add the marketplace**

```
/plugin marketplace add thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills
```

**Step 2: Install skills**

```
# Install a plugin (can bundle multiple skills)
/plugin install project-development-skills@awesome-ai-agent-skills

# Install Laravel guidelines
/plugin install laravel-app-skills@awesome-ai-agent-skills

# Install Docker local development skill
/plugin install devops-skills@awesome-ai-agent-skills

# Install office web UI skill
/plugin install office-web-ui-skills@awesome-ai-agent-skills
```

**Updating the marketplace**

```
/plugin marketplace update
```

Claude Code marketplace entries use `source: "./"`, `strict: false`, and explicit `skills` arrays so this repository can curate multiple related skill folders into one installable plugin without copying them into a Claude-specific plugin package. See the official Claude Code docs for [plugin marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) and [plugin structure](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).

### OpenAI Codex

Add this repository as a Codex marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills
```

Then install the plugin you want:

```text
codex
/plugins
```

In the plugin browser:

1. Choose the **Awesome AI Agent Skills** marketplace.
2. Open one of these plugins:
   - `project-development-skills`
   - `laravel-app-skills`
   - `devops-skills`
   - `office-web-ui-skills`
3. Select **Install plugin**.
4. Start a new thread and ask Codex normally, or type `@` to choose the plugin or one of its bundled skills explicitly.

To refresh after this repository updates:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade awesome-ai-agent-skills
```

Codex also supports installing from a local checkout while developing this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills.git
cd awesome-ai-agent-skills
codex plugin marketplace add .
```

This repository includes a Codex-compatible marketplace at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and plugin packages under `plugins/`. The layout follows OpenAI's docs: marketplace entries point at `./plugins/<plugin-name>`, plugin manifests live in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and bundled skills live inside the plugin root. See OpenAI's [Plugins](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins) and [Build plugins](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build) docs.

The repeated skill folders under `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/` are generated Codex package copies. If they differ from `skills/<skill-name>/`, edit the canonical skill folder and rerun `npm run sync`.

### Skills CLI

The open `skills` CLI works with Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and many other agents.

On macOS:

```bash
brew install skills
skills add thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills --list
skills add thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills --skill project-development-mindset
```

Without installing globally:

```bash
npx skills add thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills --list
npx skills add thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills --skill project-development-mindset
npx skills init my-skill
```

You can also copy individual skill instructions directly into your AI agent's context or system prompt.

## Usage Examples

For normal project work, start with the project mindset skill and let the agent route to related skills:

```text
Use $project-development-mindset to redesign this checkout screen, propose concepts, and verify before/after with Playwright.
```

The mindset skill checks sibling skills in this library and can switch to the right workflow when the task needs UI concepts, tests, debugging, performance, documentation, design systems, or deployment guidance.

If you want an exact workflow, invoke that skill directly:

```text
Use $ui-ux-concept-implementation to implement Concept B for this pricing page.
```

## Available Skills

<!-- SKILLS_TABLE_START -->
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [agents-md-generator](./skills/agents-md-generator) | Generate or update AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md files for AI coding agents through auto-scanning project files combined with interactive Q&A.

## Repository Cleanup

This repository has been narrowed to a smaller, cohesive set of skills that are intended to work together. Apologies to contributors whose community skills were removed during this cleanup; the goal is to keep this repository focused on quality-controlled project development workflows instead of hosting unrelated skill experiments.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's a quick start:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a skill folder: `skills/your-skill-name/`
3. Add a `SKILL.md` with metadata:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: your-skill-name
   description: What the skill does and when to use it.
   ---
   ```
4. Add the skill to `plugin-groups.json` so it belongs to exactly one plugin.
5. **Sync and validate locally before pushing:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run sync
   npm run validate
   ```
6. Submit a pull request

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** for detailed guidelines, validation instructions, and troubleshooting.

## Validation Workflow

- `plugin-groups.json` is the source of truth for plugin membership.
- `npm run sync` regenerates `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `plugins/**`, and the generated tables in `README.md`.
- `npm run validate` checks skill metadata, plugin assignments, Claude marketplace consistency, and Codex plugin package consistency.
- Pull request CI reruns `npm run sync` and fails if generated files are out of date.

## For AI Agents

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for instructions on how to work with this repository, including how to group skills into plugins and update the marketplace when new skills are added.

## Compatibility

This skill format is designed to be universal and works with:
- Claude Code (Anthropic)
- OpenAI Codex
- Cursor
- Kilo Code
- GitHub Copilot
- Windsurf
- Any AI coding assistant that supports custom instructions or skills
